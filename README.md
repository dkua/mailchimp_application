mailchimp_application
=====================

This is my code sample that makes a request to the Mandrill API to send an email which has the code sample attached to the email itself.

After compiling the program this program requires a configuration.json file. See the [configuration_sample.json](configuration_sample.json) file for an example.

To run just type
```
./mailchimp_application RECIPIENT-EMAIL
```
